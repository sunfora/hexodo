work in progress, pretty much <br>
contributions are not expected nor they are desired at the moment <br>
don't do it, don't use it, don't advertise it <br>

the thing must enter the `polished state` both from design point of view and implementation <br>
before it goes anywhere

also: it might end up being open-source commercial software <br>
currently it is not open source in license terms (there is no license)
